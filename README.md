# Tour-Planner
 This website is created using React JS Tailwind as CSS framework. With this website, users can explore a variety of tour sites, see detailed information on each tour, and add or remove tour sites from their list. 
To create this website, I used concepts such as event handling, use state, React's components, etc.
